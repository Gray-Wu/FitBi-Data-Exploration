# FitBit-Data-Exploration

## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to study trends in an existing fitness/health data collection device called FitBit. Then develope marketing recommendations for a new fitness tracker company to improve customer experience and unlock growth opportunities with their product.

### Data Source:
- [Download FitBit Tracker Data From Kaggle!](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- [FitBit Data Dictionary](https://www.fitabase.com/media/1930/fitabasedatadictionary102320.pdf)

#### Users daily activity data: 
["dailyActivity_merged.csv"](https://github.com/Gray-Wu/FitBi-Data-Exploration/blob/main/FitBit_Raw/dailyActivity_merged.csv)   
"dailyCalories_merged.csv"   
"dailyintensities_merged.csv"   
"dailySteps_merged.csv"   
"SleepDay_merged.csv"   

#### Users hourly activity data
"hourlySteps_merged.csv"    
"hourlyIntensities_merged.csv"

### Tools Used
 - Excel to validate data
 - SQL for data cleaning and analysis
 - Tableau for data visualization and creating reports

### Data Preparation/Cleaning Tasks Done in Excel

1. Inspected all 18 CSV files; data sets in the minutes range were excluded because of inconsistency and irrelevance
2. Handled all missing and incorrect values
3. Validated data values, type, and format consistency
4. Seperated date and time

### Exploratory Questions 
1. Do users that have a more active day tend to take shorter time to fall asleep than users with a less active day?
2. Is there a correlation of how many times users sleep every day and activity levels?
3. What percentage of users are getting 7 hours or 8 hours of sleep every night?
4. How positivie is the correlation between steps taken and calories burnt? What about compared to distance walked and calories burnt?
5. What percentage of users meet CDC's recommended daily steps?
### Data Cleaning and Analysis in SQL

Because the data set "dailyActivity" has every column that "dailyCalories", "dailySteps", and "dailyIntensities" have. I did three seperate ```JOIN``` queries to validate and match the data inside "dailyActivity" by Id and date.
```sql
SELECT --Selecting the calories column from both datasets and Id column from 'activity'--
  activity.Id,
  activity.Calories,
  calories.Calories
FROM
  `fitbit-data-exploration.FitBit_Tracker.daily activity` as activity
INNER JOIN
  `fitbit-data-exploration.FitBit_Tracker.daily calories` as calories
ON calories.Id = activity.Id
AND activity.ActivityDate = calories.ActivityDay --Match the date the calories value correspond to--
```

```

```


#### Limitations:

-  There are 33 users instead of the 30 users mentioned in the description of this dataset, loses some point on data integrity
-  Potentially biased data, no information on demographic, gender, age, not sure if the population is fairly represented or not as the sample size is small.
-  Data only contains 30 days of data, with some users having less data than that.
-  Sleep data set specifically have an even smaller sample size due to incomplete data, however still beneficial to include in analysis.
-  Assumed that most of the calories burnt comes from users walking/running instead of working out or other activities, data could be skewed as there are no heart rate data to reference when the user was active other than walking or running.
-  Old dataset from 2016, outdated, not for current use but historical data reference only.
